    <p>
      I am a motivated and trustworthy individual with a keen eye for detail. <br>
      I am currently studying a T-Level in Digital Production, Design and Development. <br>
      I have developed excellent communication skills with people of all ages, <br>
      along with demonstrating a willingness to learn as part of both my education and work experience. <br><br>
      As part of achieving the Bronze and Silver Duke of Edinburgh's Awards,
      I have gained valuable experience in leadership, responsibility, and problem-solving â€”
      all of which are highly transferable and beneficial in a workplace environment.
