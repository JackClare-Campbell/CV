          I ensure that customers remain safe during their climbing sessions through safety briefings
          and active monitoring. I also assist anyone who requires help getting safely down from the walls,
          which can involve both belaying and being belayed by a colleague.
          I'm currently Level 2 trained.

          I occasionally travel alongside the driver of the gaming bus where I assist with the setup,
          running, and pack down of the event. I have also helped train new staff to learn the ropes
          for the first few weeks, although I now mostly assist during corporate events.
          Working for Game Heads has required me to communicate confidently and professionally
          with both adults and children.
