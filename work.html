<p>
I occasionally travel alongside the driver of the gaming bus where I assist with the setup, running and pack down with the event.
I have also helped train new staff to learn the ropes for the first few weeks although now mostly assist during corporate events. 
Working for Game Heads has required me to be able to communicate with both adults and children with both confidence and professionalism.

<p>
I ensure that customers remain safe during their climbing sessions through safety briefings along with monitoring.
I also rescue anyone that may require assistance with getting safely down from the climbing walls which can mean both belaying or being belayed by a colleague.
I'm currently level 2 trained.
